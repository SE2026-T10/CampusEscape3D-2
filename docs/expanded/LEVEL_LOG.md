# Expanded Library — design log

One entry per layout version, newest last. Each version is built from `tools/expanded/expanded_layout.gd` (its `VERSION`) and gets:
- **its own evidence folder** `docs/expanded/vN/`;
- **its own git commit(s)**, named `level(expanded-vN): …`.

That way the history is in git as well as in the folders. The tutorial's log records five versions that landed in one commit; this log is kept one commit per version from the start.

| Evidence | Made by |
|---|---|
| `vN/layout_ground.png`, `vN/layout_upper.png` (design plans) | `tools/expanded/draw_layout.gd` |
| `vN/top_*.png`, `vN/navmesh_*.png`, `vN/views/*.png` (the built level) | `tools/expanded/capture_graybox.gd` |
| `vN/test_run.txt` | the suite (`tests/expanded_graybox_tests.gd` lines) |

Screenshots are rendered under a virtual display (Xvfb, Mesa llvmpipe software OpenGL), not on Windows hardware.

## v0 — First graybox (Expanded Library Phase 1, 2026-10-09)

Commits:
1. `level(expanded-v0): layout design and floor plans`
2. `level(expanded-v0): graybox scene, navmesh and tests`

**What:**
- Two floors and six zones:
  - ground: A Entrance & Lobby, B Main Book Stacks, C Reading Rooms & Study Wing, D Restricted Service Corridor;
  - upper: E Staff Offices & Upper Stacks, F Restricted Archive.
- Three ramp stairs (S1 lobby, S2 service, S3 stacks).
- Five planned objectives, five planned gates and one planned shortcut.
- Seven planned patrol loops and ten planned hiding spots.

The full design is in [`LAYOUT.md`](LAYOUT.md).

**Why:**
- The archive sits behind a keycard gate pair (front from the staff wing, back from the service stair), so it has a defined progression gate and two approaches.
- The upper floor has three stairs, so a guarded main stair always has a quieter alternative.
- The return route from the archive (back gate → S2 → loading dock) reuses the service corridor instead of adding a seventh zone.

**Metrics (measured on the built scene):**

| Metric | v0 |
|---|---|
| Walkable navmesh, ground / upper | 2,807 m² / 1,660 m² (tutorial: 800 sample metres, single floor) |
| Navmesh polygons | 892 (tutorial: 224) |
| Solid pieces | 215 |
| Main route along the navmesh (spawn → O1 → … → exit) | 273 m (tutorial's shortest spawn → card → exit: 102 m) |
| Planned locations reachable from the spawn | 141 / 141 |
| Gate and approach checks (rebaked with blockers) | 19 / 19 |
| Real-input walk (main route sprinting + 2 alternatives walking) | 494 m in 122 s, never stuck, never fell |

**Evidence:** [`v0/`](v0/)
- plans: `layout_ground.png`, `layout_upper.png`;
- top views: `top_ground.png`, `top_upper.png`;
- navmesh: `navmesh_ground.png`, `navmesh_upper.png`;
- 16 eye-height views in `views/`;
- `test_run.txt`, `mutation_checks.txt`.

**Open for later versions:**
- guards and their real coverage (the patrol loops are only planned);
- locks on the gates and the shortcut;
- cross-floor sight and hearing tuning;
- pacing toward the 20–30 minute target.
